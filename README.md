# MyNet
MyNet is a Internet Connectivity Status app, designed to enhance user watching control over their home Wi-Fi connection through the  essential features below:
ssid checkup: This reads the conneded wifi ssid using wifi modules.
Connection Monitoring.  Performs ping tests to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) to check connectivity. If connected, the status shows "Connected"; otherwise, "Not Connected."
Latency Analysis : Assesses ping speed to determine connection quality. Fast responses indicate a "Strong Connection"; slower ones suggest a "Weak Connection" with advice to move closer to the router.
Network Scanning : Identifies all assigned IP addresses in the local subnet, displaying the total as "Connected Devices."
Advice: Based on the ping  and latency responces this field will display if the connection is weak or strong.
